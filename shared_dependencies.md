3. Shared Variables: Variables like "current_page" might be shared across all files to keep track of the current page.

4. Shared Styles: If there are any common styles or themes, they will be shared across all pages. This could include things like color schemes, fonts, etc.

5. Shared Widgets: Common UI elements like buttons, labels, text fields, etc. will be shared across all pages.

6. Shared Data Schemas: If the pages are displaying or manipulating the same data, they will share the same data schemas.
